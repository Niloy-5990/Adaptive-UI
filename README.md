This project explores the design and evaluation of a rule-based adaptive user interface for an e-commerce website, built entirely using front-end technologies. The goal is to demonstrate how interface personalisation can be achieved without backend services, user accounts, or persistent data storage, while still supporting usability and user control.

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with all adaptation logic running on the client side. Interface behaviour is driven by clearly defined if–then rules and user-selectable presets (e.g. grid view, minimal layout, big-and-clear mode). Temporary preferences are handled through session storage and URL parameters, ensuring that no personal data is stored or transmitted.

To evaluate the design, a survey-based study was conducted where users rated the UI presets based on purpose clarity, navigation, and overall satisfaction using a 1–10 scale. The results were visualised through graphs and analysed to identify trends in user preference and perceived usability.

The project serves as a proof-of-concept for privacy-first adaptive UI design, showing that meaningful interface adaptation is possible without tracking, profiling, or machine-learning models. It is intended for educational and research purposes, particularly within human–computer interaction, usability engineering, and ethical UX design.
